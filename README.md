#User Behavior Analytics Dashboard

This project simulates and analyzes user behavior data for a digital product using Python and SQL. It highlights my ability to design an end-to-end analytics pipeline, build a dimensional data model, and generate key product metrics like DAU, retention, and funnel conversion.

Overview

Generated user and event data using Faker

Modeled a star schema with fact and dimension tables

Wrote ETL logic to transform raw logs into structured warehouse tables

Computed metrics: DAU, WAU, retention cohorts, funnel steps

Exported results as CSVs for reporting and visualization

Stack

Python, Pandas, Faker

CSV-based warehouse (PostgreSQL optional)

Outputs

fact_user_event.csv, dim_user.csv, etc.

daily_active_users.csv, retention_matrix_percent.csv, funnel_analysis.csv

Why it matters

This project reflects real-world data engineering work: cleaning event data, modeling it for analytics, and producing metrics that help drive product decisions.
